# Reproducible Research

---
# Why Reproducibility?

Reproducibility is not *replication*.

* **Replication** is running a new study to show if and how results of a prior study hold.
* **Reproducibility** is about rerunning *the same study* and getting the *same results*.

--

Reproducible studies can still be *wrong*... and in fact reproducibility makes proving a study wrong *much easier*.

--

Reproducibility means:

* Transparent research practices.
* Minimal barriers to verifying your results.

--

*Any study that isn't reproducible can be trusted only on faith.*

---
# Reproducibility Definitions

Reproducibility comes in three forms (Stodden 2014):

--

1. **Empirical:** Repeatability in data collection.

--

2. **Statistical:** Verification with alternate methods of inference.

--

3. **Computational:** Reproducibility in cleaning, organizing, and presenting data and results.

--

R is particularly well suited to enabling **computational reproducibility**.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[[1] Python is equally well suited.]

--

They will not fix flawed research design, nor offer a remedy for improper application of statistical methods.

Those are the difficult, non-automatable things you want skills in.

---

## Computational Reproducibility

Elements of computational reproducibility:

--

* Shared data

   + Researchers need your original data to verify and replicate your work.

--

* Shared code
   + Your code must be shared to make decisions transparent.

--

* Documentation
   + The operation of code should be either self-documenting or have written descriptions to make its use clear.

--

* **Version Control**
   + Documents the research process.
   + Prevents losing work and facilitates sharing.

---

## Levels of Reproducibility

For academic papers, degrees of reproducibility vary:

0. "Read the article"

--

1. Shared data with documentation

--

2. Shared data and all code

--

3. **Interactive document**

--

4. **Research compendium**

--

5. Docker compendium: Self-contained ecosystem

---
## Interactive Documents

**Interactive documents**—like R Markdown docs—combine code and text together into a self-contained document.
   * Load and process data
   * Run models
   * Generate tables and plots in-line with text
   * In-text values automatically filled in

--

Interactive documents allow a reader to examine your computational methods within the document itself; in effect, they are self-documenting.

--

By re-running the code, they reproduce your results on demand.

--

Common Platforms:

 * **R:** R Markdown ([an example of mine](https://clanfear.github.io/birthtiming/inst/paper/paper.html))
 * **Python:** Jupyter Notebooks

---
## Research Compendia

A **research compendium** is a portable, reproducible distribution of an article or other project.

--

Research compendia feature:

* An interactive document as the foundation

* Files organized in a recognizable structure (e.g. an R package)

* Clear separation of data, method, and output. *Data are read only*.

* A well-documented or even *preserved* computational environment (e.g. Docker)

--

`rrtools` by UW's [Ben Markwick](https://github.com/benmarwick) provides a simplified workflow to accomplish this in R.

[Here is an example compendium of mine.](https://github.com/clanfear/birthtiming)

---
## Bookdown

[`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)—which is integrated into `rrtools`—can generate documents in the proper format for articles, theses, books, or dissertations.

--

`bookdown` provides an accessible alternative to writing `\(\LaTeX\)` for typesetting and reference management.

--

You can integrate citations and automate reference page generation using bibtex files (such as produced by Zotero).

--

`bookdown` supports `.html` output for ease and speed and also renders `.pdf` files through `\(\LaTeX\)` for publication-ready documents.

--

For University of Washington theses and dissertations, consider Ben Marwick's [`huskydown` package](https://github.com/benmarwick/huskydown) which uses Markdown but renders via a UW approved `\(\LaTeX\)` template.

# Best Practices

## Organization and Portability

---
# Organization Systems

Organizing research projects is something you either do accidentally—and badly—or purposefully with some upfront labor.

--

Uniform organization makes switching between or revisiting projects easier.

--

I suggest something like the following:

.pull-left[
```
project/
   readme.md
   data/
     derived/
       processed_data.RData
     raw/
       core_data.csv
   docs/
     paper.Rmd
   syntax/
     functions.R
     models.R
```
]
.pull-right[
1. There is a clear hierarchy
   * Written content is in `docs`
   * Code is in `syntax`
   * Data is in `data`
2. Naming is uniform
   * All lower case
   * Words separated by underscores
3. Names are self-descriptive

]

---
# Workflow versus Project

To summarize Jenny Bryan, [one should separate workflow from projects.](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

--

.pull-left[
### Workflow

* The software you use to write your code (e.g. RStudio)

* The location you store a project

* The specific computer you use

* The code you ran earlier or typed into your console
]

--

.pull-right[
### Project

* The raw data

* The code that operates on your raw data

* The packages you use

* The output files or documents
]

--

Projects *should not modify anything outside of the project* nor need to be modified by someone else (or future you) to run.

**Projects *should be independent of your workflow*.**

---
# Portability

For research to be reproducible, it must also be *portable*. Portable software operates *independently of workflow* such as fixed file locations.

--

**Do Not:**

* Use `setwd()` in scripts or .Rmd files.
* Use *absolute paths* except for *fixed, immovable sources* (secure data).
  + `read_csv("C:/my_project/data/my_data.csv")`
* Use `install.packages()` in script or .Rmd files.
* Use `rm(list=ls())` anywhere but your console.

--

**Do:**

* Use RStudio projects (or the [`here` package](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)) to set directories.
* Use *relative paths* to load and save files:
  + `read_csv("./data/my_data.csv")`
* Load all required packages using `library()`.
* Clear your workspace when closing RStudio.
  + Set *Tools &gt; Global Options... &gt; Save workspace...* to **Never**

---
# Divide and Conquer

Often you do not want to include all the code for a project in a single `.Rmd` file:

   * The code takes too long to knit.
   * The file is so long it is difficult to read.

--

There are two ways to deal with this:

1. Use separate `.R` scripts or `.Rmd` files which save results from complicated parts of a project, then load these results in the main `.Rmd` file.

   + This is good for loading and cleaning large data.
   + Also for running slow models.

--

2. Use `source()` to run external `.R` scripts.

   + This can be used to run large files that aren't impractically slow.
   + Also good for loading project-specific functions.

---
# The Way of Many Files

I find it beneficial to break projects into *many* files:
   * Scripts with specialized functions.
   * Scripts to load and clean each set of variables.
   * Scripts to run each set of models and make tables and plots.
   * A main .Rmd that runs some or all of these to reproduce the entire project.

--

Splitting up a project carries benefits:
   * Once a portion of the project is done and in its own file, *it is out of your way.*
   * If you need to make changes, you don't need to search through huge files.
   * Entire sections of the project can be added or removed quickly (e.g. converted to an appendix of an article)
   * **It is the only way to build a proper *pipeline* for a project. **

---
# Pipelines

Professional researchers and teams design projects as a **pipeline**.

--

A **pipeline** is a series of consecutive processing elements (scripts and functions in R).

--

Each stage of a pipeline...

1. Has clearly defined inputs and outputs
2. Does not modify its inputs.
3. Produces the exact same output every time it is re-run.

--

This means...

1. When you modify one stage, you only need to rerun *subsequent stages*.
2. Different people can work on each stage.
3. Problems are isolated within stages.
4. You can depict your project as a *directed graph* of **dependencies**.

---

# Example Pipeline

Every stage (oval) has an unambiguous input and output. Everything that precedes a given stage is a **dependency**—something required to run it.

# Tools

### *Some opinionated advice*

---
# On Formats

Avoid "closed" or commercial software and file formats except where absolutely necessary.

--

Use open source software and file formats.

--

* It is always better for *science*:

   + People should be able to explore your research without buying commercial software.
   + You do not want your research to be inaccessible when software is updated.

--

* It is often just *better*.

   + It is usually updated more quickly
   + It tends to be more secure
   + It is rarely abandoned

--

**The ideal:** Use software that reads and writes *raw text*.

---
# Text

Writing and formatting documents are two completely separate jobs.
   * Write first
   * Format later
   * [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) was made for this

--

Word processors—like Microsoft Word—try to do both at the same time, usually badly.

They waste time by leading you to format instead of writing.

--

Find a good modular text editor and learn to use it:
   * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
   * [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (Commercial)
   * Emacs
   * Vim

---

# Version Control

---
# Version Control

Version control originates in collaborative software development.

**The Idea:** All changes ever made to a piece of software are documented, saved automatically, and revertible.

--

Version control allows all decisions ever made in a research project to be documented automatically.

--

Version control can:

1. Protect your work from destructive changes
2. Simplify collaboration by merging changes
3. Document design decisions
4. Make your research process transparent

---
# Git and GitHub

[`git`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is the dominant platform for version control, and [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a free (and now Microsoft owned) platform for hosting **repositories**.

--

**Repositories** are folders on your computer where all changes are tracked by Git.

--

Once satisfied with changes, you "commit" them then "push" them to a remote repository that stores your project.

--

Others can copy your project ("pull"), and if you permit, make suggestions for changes.

--

Constantly committing and pulling changes automatically generates a running "history" that documents the evolution of a project.

--

`git` is integrated into RStudio under the *Tools* menu. [It requires some setup.](http://happygitwithr.com/)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[[1] You can also use the [GitHub desktop application](https://desktop.github.com/).]


---
# GitHub as a CV

Beyond archiving projects and allowing sharing, GitHub also serves as a sort of curriculum vitae for the programmer.

--

By allowing others to view your projects, you can display competence in programming and research.

--

If you are planning on working in the private sector, an active GitHub profile will give you a leg up on the competition.

--

If you are aiming for academia, a GitHub account signals technical competence and an interest in research transparency.
