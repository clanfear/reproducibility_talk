"[The audience is] PhD students of mostly 1 and 2 years who need a guidance about the life of PhD"

"Could you briefly share your knowledge to guide us so that we can broad our perspectives in the research in terms of quantitative and data driven way?"

"[Share your] knowledge or experience in data analytics or the related research methodologies"

Given the above I am going to focus on general advice and things to refer them to rather than anything specific or overly technical. That is, I'll introduce a holistic approach to research design and project management which links into reproducible research. I'll talk about some tools related to this (R, RMarkdown, Python, Jupyter Notebooks), and general practices.

Things to talk about:
 1) Get reproducibility stuff from birthtiming presentation
 2) Talk about folder structures
 3) Non-destructive practices
 4) Version control
 5) Open formats
